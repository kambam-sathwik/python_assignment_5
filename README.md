🔹 Task 1: Student Marks Lookup Using Dictionary

This Python program stores student names and their corresponding marks using a dictionary. It prompts the user to enter a student’s name and checks whether the name exists in the dictionary. If found, the program displays the student’s marks; otherwise, it shows a “Student Name Not Found” message. This program demonstrates dictionary usage and key-based lookup in Python.

🔹 Task 2: List Slicing and Reversal

This Python program works with a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It extracts the first five elements using list slicing and then reverses the extracted list. The program prints the original list, the sliced list, and the reversed list, illustrating list slicing and reverse operations in Python.
